            We also respect a manufacturer's right to enter into exclusive distribution or resale agreements for its products. However, violations of such agreements do not constitute intellectual property rights infringement. As the enforcement of these agreements is a matter between the manufacturer, distributor and/or respective reseller, it would not be appropriate for us to assist in the enforcement of such activities. While we cannot provide legal advice, nor share private information as protected by the law, we recommend that any questions or concerns regarding your rights may be routed to a legal specialist.
